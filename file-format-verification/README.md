## File Format Verification Tool (work in progress)

The File Format Verification Tool is an electronic file format verification tool for filers who wish to confirm that a LAR is formatted in the required pipe delimited text file format. This verification tool will be available on a webpage that runs independently from the HMDA Platform and provides a convenient test mechanism for filers. https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform
